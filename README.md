# Naive-bayes-on-iris
Iris dataset is a datset present in sklearn datasets.
In this notebook I have implemented naive bayes by my own for datas having discrete values, then trained a model on iris data as iris data have continuous values so I have first converted it into discrete values and then checked the precision and recall value. Then applied Inbuilt sklearn naive bayes classfier for continuous values create a model fit the data into it then print the classification report and compare the precision and recall value as calculated before.
